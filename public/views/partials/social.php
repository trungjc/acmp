They produce edible unicellular micro-organisms that can contain more than 60% crude protein with a value that could be three-to-five times higher than the energy mineral/nutrient value of the waste. The majority of organic and nutrient waste produced at a slaughterhouse is transported in the wastewater stream, so initial AMPC research in this area focused on combined wastewater. This research identified purple hototrophic bacteria (PPB) as a promising and novel process for wastewater treatment, and it has been applied to domestic wastewater treatment. The current proposal is designed to continue research into PPB and apply red meat processing applications. The aim is to establish the technology and demonstrate the value proposition of complete resource recovery from red meat processing wastewater streams. And while recent SCP work has focused on combined wastewater, solid wastes also represent a major source of organic and nutrient contaminants from slaughterhouses. The characteristics of solid waste are considerably different to combined wastewater and this likely impacts technology suitability and process selection. This project expands the program to investigate whether SCP technologies are suitable for meat processing solid wastes.">Read more</button>
