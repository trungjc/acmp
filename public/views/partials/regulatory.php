									<button class="btn-start btn-am" data-info-project="This substantive project has two stages. Stage 1 comprises an economic analysis of the costs of audit and certification, and policy analysis to generate options for reducing duplication and improving effectiveness. It will use an economic impact model developed for the AMPC and based on a set of cost and revenue data provided by processors over the past 15 years. It will also develop sub-models to assess the potential benefit to the industry, and the broader economy, of regulatory and quasi-regulatory changes to industry audits and export certification. Stage 2 comprises an international cost comparison analysis. It will update the Australian processing cost data to enable real-time comparison, expand the coverage of the data to include key processing cost items, in addition to the regulatory costs previously analysed, and then extend the geographic coverage of the data to the USA, Argentina and Brazil. It will also develop an international cost comparison model which will enable key components of processing costs in four countries to be analysed, using both public and private data sources. This will help support public policy and commercial cost-reduction initiatives. Processors will have a significant incentive to provide data to the project, as those providing a full set will receive an individual report comparing their costs with Australian and international country averages. This approach has proved successful in encouraging participation in a current project being undertaken by the AMPC.">Read more</button>
