									<button class="btn-start btn-am" data-info-project="From a consumer’s perspective, tenderness is one of the most important qualities sought when buying meat. Due to intrinsic differences in connective tissue, protease levels and rigor shortening in different muscles, and animal factors such as genetics, HGP treatment and pre-slaughter stress, consistent delivery of tender, juicy meat products is an ongoing challenge for the meat industry. In addition, meat ageing for tenderisation purpose is a complex biological process and optimising the ageing conditions is time and labour-intensive. Beef generally requires a minimum of five days’ ageing to assure tenderness, although meat from some animals can require up to 14 days to reach acceptable levels of tenderness. The ageing process also presents challenges in storage space, power and a slower turnover of vacuum-packed primals (large sections of the carcass). So accelerating the ageing process is of significant interest for the meat industry. This project will explore, in collaboration with a meat technology centre in Ireland, emerging technologies to shorten and control the ageing process. The intended outcome is new knowledge on how to combine technology to produce consistently tender meat for fresh, ready-to-eat and food service outlets.">Read more</button>
